To install PROS on a CLOUD9 Server:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi
sudo apt-get install  libnewlib-arm-none-eabi
sudo dpkg --install libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib_4.9.3+svn227297-1+8_all.deb 
sudo dpkg --install pros-core-2.6.1-amd64.deb
pros conduct first-run

Then, download a sample set of code.
(see pros-demo or pros-hellow-world)

Change to the directory, modify "opcontrol.c".
	pros make clean
	pros make
	(It also is possible to bypass the pros command and simply make clean; make)

This will generate a /bin/output.bin file that must be transfered to the Cortext.
Download this file to a Windows machine.
Use a Window machine to transfer it.
	pros upload -f output.bin

Then, may use putty to view printf statements on com port with speed 115200.
	

If it desired to upload the output file with Easy C, perform the following operation:
	arm-none-eabi-objcopy ./bin/output.elf -O ihex ./bin/output.hex
	
Then, use the easyC's iLoader.exe file to upload the file.
